    <h1>MESH - Changelog</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.13 (released Oct. 25th 2004)</h2>
 The incremental patch between version 1.12 and 1.13 is available <a href="patch-1.12-1.13.gz">here</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Previous cleanup introduced new bugs. Fix bugs</li>
		<li>Added a (basic) OFF model file reader</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Version 1.12 (released August 18th 2004)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.11 and 1.12 is available <a href="patch-1.11-1.12.gz">here</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Cleanup of the file format detection code</li>
		<li>Fixed (again) the case when a file starts with whitespaces</li>
		<li>Corrected the cell_sz computation logic (pointed out by Xia Ning)
	</ul>
    <h2>Version 1.11 (released Apr 30th 2004)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.10 and 1.11 is available <a href="patch-1.10-1.11.gz">here</a>.
   	<ul>
	    <li>Fixed a bug in the file format detection code (SMF files with no leading comments were incorrectly read)</li>
  	    <li>Allow files to have spaces in the 1st lines (occurs for some raw files)</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Version 1.10 (released May 27th 2003)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.9 and 1.10 is available <a href="patch-1.9-1.10.gz">here</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Added support for panning the 3D views, activated 
	with Ctrl key+left button mouse dragging.</li>
        <li>Split 'RawWidget' into more readable (and hopefully cleaner) classes
	<ul>
                <li>Basic3DViewerWidget is the class that implements basic
                  functions (and inherits QGLWidget)</li>
                <li>The left GL windows derives from Basic3DViewerWidget and
                  is implemented in the Error3DViewerWidget class</li>
                <li>The right GL windows also derives from Basic3DViewerWidget
                  and is implemented in Lighted3DViewerWidget</li>
	</ul></li>
        <li> Added the spec file in the distribution.</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Version 1.9 (released March 26th 2003)</h2>
 The incremental patch between version 1.8 and 1.9 is available <a href="patch-1.8-1.9.gz">here</a>.
	<ul>
	     <li>Added support for reading raw format with binary data: it provides much faster I/O, at the expense of portability.</li>
	     <li>Help message fixes</li>
	     <li>Fixed (rare) buffer overflows in model input routines</li>
	     <li>Fixed behavior of the 'demo' mode, so that any attempt to move the models when running this mode is ignored</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Version 1.8 (released January 15th 2003)</h2>
 The incremental patch between version 1.7 and 1.8 is available <a href="patch-1.7-1.8.gz">here</a>.
    <ul>
	<li>Added prettier debug prints when DEBUG is defined at compile time</li>
        <li>Fixed the return code of 'read_smf_tmesh' (should be 1 if success)</li>
        <li>Added a 'demo' mode (i.e. the models turn without intervention)</li>
        <li>Fixed the switching between GL_LINE and GL_FILL polygon mode by
          forcing a call to 'rebuildList' (otherwise caused a 'black-screen'
          syndrome, esp. in the right RawWidget)</li>
        <li>Updated copyright years</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.7 (released November 5th 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.6 and 1.7 is available <a href="patch-1.6-1.7.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>Removed deprecated stuff from 'geomutils.c'</li>
      <li>Better triangle area computation, and thus better degeneracy handling in 'compute_error.c'</li>
      <li>Removed a potential buffer overflow when refilling the buffer in 'model_in.c'. The buffer will now use 'grow_array' when needed.</li>
      <li>Tweaks for float_scanf on Win32 (still slow ...)</li>
      <li>Replaced most of the 'grow_arrays' by single-linked lists of memory block. Much faster (twice!) on Win32 than realloc-ing a big array. And not slower on Linux...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.6 (released August 30th 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.5 and 1.6 is available <a href="patch-1.5-1.6.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>Updated the paper status in copyright headers (no longer 'submitted to' but 'published in')</li>
      <li>Added a basic PLY reader (ASCII and binary)</li>
      <li>Split 'model_in.c' into per-format files</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.5 (released June 6th 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.4 and 1.5 is available <a href="patch-1.4-1.5.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>Added the possibility to display the error in grayscale (useful for making screenshots that *have* to be in grayscale...)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.4 (released May 7th 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.3 and 1.4 is available <a href="patch-1.3-1.4.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>'-malign-double' causes troubles when compiling C++ files with Qt 3.x. We now only use it when compiling C files.</li>
      <li>Fixed (hopefully definitely) this lousy formatting on both the external window and console.</li>
      <li>Made the main widget display a caption containing the filename of each model.</li>
      <li>Added a basic CPU detection (Linux only) in the Makefile (mostly for the Intel and PGCC compilers)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.3 (released April 22nd 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.2 and 1.3 is available <a href="patch-1.2-1.3.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed memory allocation bug for non-manifold models in add_adj_face_extra() (mis-sized realloc leading to memory corruption)</li>
      <li>Added support for compiling with PGCC (Portland Group) compiler</li>
      <li>Optimization: align doubles at 8 byte boundaries on x86</li>
      <li>Default to Penitum IV only builds with PGCC and ICC compilers</li>
      <li>When detecting the file format, check for file error before returning.</li>
      <li>Fixed incorrect handling of unknown nodes (color and texCoord). They are now skipped (hopefully) without failure.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.2 (released April 15th 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.1 and 1.2 is available <a href="patch-1.1-1.2.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the reading low-level functions : 'buf_getc' did not read the last char of the data block</li>
      <li>Added possibility to read basic Inventor 2.x and SMF files</li>
      <li>Fixed a mishandling of vertices having only one incident faces when analyzing the model</li>
      <li>Fixed a bad initialization of 'data-&gt;pos' to 0 that caused a read at -1 (thanks <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj">Valgrind</a> ...)</li>
      <li>Fixed : field 'builtin_normals' of 'struct model' should only be set if the vertex normals are present (not for the face normals)</li>
      <li>Added/Updated comments in 'model_in.[ch]'</li>
      <li>Minor tweaks in the block size in 'model_in.c'</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
     
    <h2>Version 1.1 (released April 8th 2002)</h2>
    The incremental patch between version 1.0 and 1.1 is available <a href="patch-1.0-1.1.gz">here</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>Added possibility to read gzipped VRML using zlib</li>
      <li>Fixed build under IRIX and Solaris</li>
      <li>Better output in the external window</li>
      <li>Fixed potential bug in VRML parsing : cases when there is no space between a keyword and a '[' or a '{' were badly handled.</li>
    </ul>
